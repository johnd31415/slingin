Attempt at disc golf weapons in terraria. WIP

## Current goals:
- Balance (damage/recipes are currently slightly off the cuff)
- Animations/sound effects

## More lofty and/or not thought out goals:
- Playable Disc golf with baskets
- NPC for KC?
- Enemies/Bosses?
- Accessories?
- Better sprites (read: not made by me)

## Setup (if you want to develop, players can simply use tmodloader mod browser)
- Clone repository into C:\Users\{User}\Documents\My Games\Terraria\tModLoader\ModSources
- Launch tmodloader and build mod from Workshop -> Develop Mods

## Credits:
- johnd31415 - Dev and sprites
- adamabrey - Ideas and code review
